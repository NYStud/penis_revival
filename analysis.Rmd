A while ago, [I analyzed the World Penis Data](https://blog.jemu.name/post/2015/08/i-analyzed-some-world-penis-data---because-why-not/), because let's face it, the inclined data enthusiast can't resist a dataset like [this](www.everyoneweb.com/worldpenissize). Sadly, my old code to scrape the table on that page doesn't work anymore, and I have not figured out a new way to get the data, so I have to rely on the data I saved the last time and included in the [tadaadata/loldata](github.com/tadaadata/loldata) package.  

Anyway, long story short: I don't like the look of my old analysis, because that was done in a time before I bothered with ggplot2-prettification. So now we try this again.
